Custom Tool Agent Example

This example demonstrates how to create an agent that uses a custom tool.
In this instance, we create a "WeatherTool" that the agent can call to 
retrieve (mock) weather information. This helps to illustrate how the 
agent processes user inputs, routes tool calls, and manages the conversation
history.

Key Concepts:
    - BaseAgent: The core agent that manages conversation state and LLM calls.
    - BaseTool: The abstraction for tools, allowing integration of domain-specific functionality.
    - Tool usage: When the agent detects a request that requires a tool, it delegates the action.

Usage:
    Run this module to see the agent in action. The agent will prompt for a city 
    name and then use the WeatherTool to return mock weather data.

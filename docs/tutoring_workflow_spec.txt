# Tutoring Workflow Technical Specification

## Overview
A demonstration example showcasing how to build multi-agent educational workflows using the Babelgraph framework. This example implements a simple tutoring session between a student and professor, culminating in a quiz to test understanding.

## Goals
1. Demonstrate core Babelgraph features for multi-agent orchestration
2. Show how to build interactive, turn-based agent workflows
3. Provide a clear example of structured agent communication
4. Showcase framework's state management and workflow control

## Key Features to Demonstrate

### 1. Multi-Agent Interaction
- Student agent for asking questions and taking quiz
- Professor agent for providing explanations
- Turn-based interaction system
- Structured communication between agents

### 2. Structured Data Flow
- Pydantic models for all agent inputs/outputs
- Type-safe data passing between nodes
- Clear response schemas for questions and answers
- Structured quiz format and evaluation

### 3. State Management
- Track conversation turns
- Manage quiz state
- Handle agent memory/context
- Control workflow transitions

### 4. Workflow Control
- Graph-based node system
- Clear state transitions
- Terminal conditions (quiz completion)
- Error handling and recovery

### 5. Framework Features
- Async execution
- Streaming responses
- Rich logging
- Event handling
- Error management

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Response Models
- StudentQuestion: Format student queries
- ProfessorResponse: Structure teaching responses
- QuizResponse: Format quiz answers and evaluation

### 2. Workflow Nodes
- StudentNode: Handle student interactions
- ProfessorNode: Process and respond to questions
- QuizNode: Manage quiz delivery and evaluation

### 3. State Tracking
- Turn counter
- Conversation history
- Quiz status
- Learning progress

### 4. Runtime Configuration
- Streaming setup
- Logging configuration
- Error handling
- Event management

## Interaction Flow

1. Student asks question about topic
2. Professor provides explanation
3. Repeat for N turns
4. Transition to quiz mode
5. Evaluate understanding
6. Provide final assessment

## Success Metrics

### Functional
- Complete interaction cycle
- Successful quiz completion
- Proper state transitions
- Error recovery

### Technical
- Clean async execution
- Proper streaming
- Structured data flow
- State consistency

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Separate response models
- Clean node implementations
- Clear state management
- Proper error handling

### Best Practices
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Document all components
- Handle edge cases
- Implement proper logging

### Framework Usage
- Leverage Babelgraph primitives
- Use built-in state management
- Implement proper node patterns
- Follow framework conventions
